#### Running migrations in your app has never been easier: inspired by the migratory Monarch butterfly.

For a more detailed introduction to Monarch, check out my blog post [introducing Monarch](https://build.ms/2024/10/23/minimal-manageable-migrations-with-monarch).

You donâ€™t always get it right the first time. Thatâ€™s why pencils have erasers â€” and why apps have migrations.

- **Simple Migrations**: Define independent migrations without worrying about state management, making it easy to evolve your app over time.

- **Built for Swift and SwiftUI**: Monarchâ€™s migrations feel right at home in any Swift app, with a clean SwiftUI API.

- **Dependency Injection**: Whether your migration is simple or complex, Monarchâ€™s easy-to-use dependency injection provides structure to prevent data-related issues.

### Getting Started

Setting up migrations in your app is simple:

1. **Define your migrations** using the `Migration` protocol.
2. **Add your migrations** to a `MigrationGroup`.
3. **Run your migrations** using the `runMigrations` view modifier.

```swift
// 1. Define a migration
struct MigrateAuthTokenToKeychain: Migration {
    @MigrationDependency private var userDefaultsAppState
    @MigrationDependency private var keychainAppState

    static let id: MigrationID = "MigrateAuthTokenToKeychain"

    func run() async throws {
        // Migrate the auth token that should have never been stored in UserDefaults over to the Keychain ðŸ˜±
        keychainAppState.authToken = userDefaultsAppState.authToken

        userDefaultsAppState.authToken = nil
    }
}
```

```swift
// 2. Group your migrations and add dependencies
let migrations = MigrationGroup {
    MigrateAuthTokenToKeychain()
    // Add more migrations here
}
.migrationDependency(self.userDefaultsAppState)
.migrationDependency(self.keychainAppState)
```

```swift
// 3. Run migrations in your SwiftUI app
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, Monarch! ðŸ¦‹")
            .runMigrations {
                migrations
            }
    }
}
```

Thatâ€™s all you need to get started with Monarch! Add as many migrations and dependencies as needed to help evolve your app over time.

### Advanced Usage

Monarch offers various ways to customize and control your migration process:

#### Manually run migrations

If the timing of migrations is crucial in your app, you can use the `MigrationRunner` for full control. Hereâ€™s an example of an app that leverages Monarchâ€™s functionality to manually run migrations:

```swift
struct ButterflyTrackerApp: App {
    @State var appState = AppState()
    @State var preferences = Preferences()
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .task { 
                    try await self.runMigrations()
                }
        }
    }
    
    func runMigrations() async throws {
        MigrationRunner.removeAllMigrations()

        MigrationRunner.markMigrationAsCompleted(withID: ResetButterflyListMigration.id)
        
        let migrationGroup = MigrationGroup {
            ProvideButterlyFansPremiumAccountAccessMigration()
            RemoveAccidentallyAddedMothMigration()
        }
        .migrationDependency(self.appState)
        .migrationDependency(self.preferences)

        try await MigrationRunner.runMigrations({ migrationGroup })
    }
}
```

#### MigrationRunner API

```swift
// Run the migrations in a MigrationGroup.
public static func runMigrations(_ migrationGroup: MigrationGroup) async throws

// Mark a migration as completed, without actually running it. This is useful when transitioning to Monarch from another migration system.
public static func markMigrationAsCompleted(withID id: MigrationID)

// Remove a specific migration that has previously run, allowing it to be re-run.
public static func removeMigration(withID id: MigrationID)

// Remove all previously run migrations.
public static func removeAllMigrations()
```

> [!NOTE]
> Monarch stores its list of completed migrations in UserDefaults, which can take up to 7 seconds to synchronize. If the user re-runs these migrations within this 7-second window, such as by relaunching the app, migrations *may* be re-run.


### Requirements

- iOS 17.0+
- macOS 14.0+
- Xcode 14+
- Swift 5.10+

### Installation

#### Swift Package Manager

Add Monarch as a dependency in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yourusername/Monarch.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```

Then, add Monarch to your target dependencies:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourTarget",
        dependencies: ["Monarch"]
    )
]
```

#### Manually

If you prefer not to use SPM, you can integrate Monarch into your project manually by copying the files from the `Sources/Monarch` directory.
